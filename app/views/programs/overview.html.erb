    <td class="tg-yw4l">Welcome to LumpaWorld! The silly people who live here come in four types: Rollies (marbles) can only roll places; Skybumps (stickers) only fly in little airplanes; Bouncers (pom-poms) can only launch themselves with catapults; Swooshers (packing peanuts) can only ride on ziplines. When disaster hits, will you be able to get them home in time?</td>
